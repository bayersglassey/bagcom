These articles are attempts to write up some of the theory and implementation
of my "geom2018" project, which is a graphics & game engine based around tesselations
of the plane by regular polygons (largely squares & triangles).

The name "geom2018" is just the name of the Git repo in which I began the project's most
successful incarnation, back in 2018.
However, I've been thinking about this project, and starting & abandoning small implementations
of it, for several years before that.

The primary outcome of the project has been the [Spider Game](depths.html).
